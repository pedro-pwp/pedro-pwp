# Pedro Lima

## Hello Everyone!ðŸ‘‹
<br/>:computer: &nbsp; I started in this world, cause I love technology and how it solves problems. 
<br/>:memo: &nbsp; My first project is a Website that I'm developing with all the NLW community.
<br/>:rocket: &nbsp; I'm starting to learn **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** at **NLW** with **Rocketseat** support.
<br/>:soon: &nbsp; I love the back-end process, but I'll work very hard to become a **Full Stack developer** and resolve how much problem as I can.
<br/>:mortar_board: &nbsp;  I studied to become a Civil Engineer for 3 years at **UTFPR**, but now I'm transferring to Software Engineering at **IFPR**.
<br/> ðŸ’¬  &nbsp; About Me: I love games and all this world. Should be a great challenge to develop a game.
